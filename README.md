Hi Susan,

Good afternoon. This is my attempt at implementing a GridLayout from scratch. I admittedly didn't get as far as I'd hoped but I had to cut my time short to run my kid to an event.
My plan going forward would've been to capture the Height and Width of the parent view then either divide the height or the width by 2 and place a view in the corresponding coordinate. I also had a boolean to represent
if the grid will be divided horizontally or vertically every 3rd iteration. Thank you for your time.

Regards,
Rohan
